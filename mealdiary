# TO DO
#1. collect the demographic info from the user. --> input() store in 
# variables/lists/dictionaries
#2. define daily recommended calorie intake based on the data they gave you 
#and information from the web --> math formulas to calculate
#3. allow a user to enter information about one meal --> input() store in 
# variables/lists/dictionaries
#4. calculate the number of calories from that meal (based on some info 
# available online) --> JSON/CSV data from the web (some info source) that 
# allows you to search for what you are looking for and retrieve appropriate 
# information


# Collect Gender, Age, Weight, Height
# Covert height to inches
# Use Harris-Benedict Formula to calcuate calore intake
# http://www.healthfitonline.com/resources/harris_benedict.php
# Calculate BMR
# Calculate Calories
# Print Calorie Intake Result to Screen

# Validate input - must be a double or int

# Validate input - must be 1 or 2

# validate input - can be inches or feet and inches
uHeight = input("Enter your height: ")
# convert height to inches

# Collect foods eaten
# Match foods eaten with calories for each food
# Add calories
# Print Calories to Screen
# Subtract entered meals calories from day's calorie total
